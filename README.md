# Landing Page
This repo is for my project recreating this landing page for the course 'The Odin Project'

It is a css practice project to learn the fundamentals of css as well as flexbox

In the images folder you can see the example image I recreated to the best of my ability, as well as the image containing the references for the colors and text. Both images belong to The Odin Project, and you can find it in their Foundations Course, the section "Project: Landing Page"
